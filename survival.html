	<p id="text"><span class="question">How Would The World Respond?:</span>  Because nuclear would have a warning the city could send a message to run shortly after the blast wave passes your shelter then shortly after fire fighters would try and save as many people as they can extracting them from rubble and taking injured people to nearby hospitals a few hours later nearby airports would drop geiger counters, instructions how to use them, clean water to prevent people from drinking radioactive rain, an in depth breakdown of understanding where to go for shelter (concrete buildings far from the blast etc), and the basics of radiation. Long term would be measuring the locations to study when the radiation comes back down to safe levels which could take hundreds of years. Then would be rebuilding assuming there is a government to rebuild.<br>
	<span class="question">What To Do In A Disaster?:</span>  One if there is over 3 hours warning people should drive as far away as they can anyone over 80km away should be completely safe and if there is less time everyone should try and find a concrete building either a basement or otherwise keeping in mind not to be outside when it goes off. Hiding until either people come to rescue them or they receive a message saying that it is safe to run to less radiated ground, and with no warning which could be possible when the bright flash happens and you realize it's a nuclear bomb don't look a the flash as you will go blind, and try to find anything to protect you from the shockwave either a ditch or a log however no a building as if it collapses it will collapse onto you, then lie on the ground face down covering the back of your head and neck with your hands you will start to get burns on any exposed skin because of the heat you won't be able to feel once it has cooled enough so slowly lift your hands to feel the heat and if it's ok to get up and try to run to the nearest hospital and do not drink any rainwater as it will be highly radioactive.<br></p>

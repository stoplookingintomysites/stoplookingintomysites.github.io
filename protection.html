	<span class="question">How To Detect And Predict Nuclear War?:</span>  Prediction can happen in a few ways, if the nukes are dropped from a plane you can detect when unidentified airplanes are in the area. However first attacks are more likely to be from missiles because they have less time to detect them, and it's more likely there wont be much time to stop the missile. There are systems are in place to detect and stop missiles. First detecting them we use radar technology that send radio waves and then studies how they bounce to see in a similar way to bats echolocate. There are also systems in place to stop missiles most commonly a missile that launches to smash into the ICBM (inter-continental ballistic missile) and blow both up destroying the warhead these are commonly called a SAMs.<br>
	<span class="question">New Ways Of Detecting Nukes?:</span>  With research on infrared technology (being able to see heat) detecting ICBMs are extremely easy as it wouldn't matter if it was a foggy day (something the attackers might wait for), they could use previous technology like radar to discover them at a distance, then use infrared to make sure it's an actual ICBM and not say a meteor which would not leave as strong and precise of a heat trail, where an ICBM would leave a clean streak in a consistent trajectory. Then once discovered launch countermeasures.<br>
	<span class="question">What Causes Nuclear War To Be More Lethal?:</span>  Nuclear bombs are extremely powerful as they create a shock wave when they detonate, this is the most deadly because it is extremely hot and will destroy any shelters that are not strong enough to withstand it. If you are outside when the bomb comes the wave will instantly kill you because of the pressure and force, long before the heat or radiation could do anything however there is nothing you can do if you are too close to it because the fire ball will level the nearby area in about a 10-30 km radius but outside that, buildings that are resistant to earthquakes should be fine as well as people knowing about how dangerous they are such as looking at the blast will make you go blind in a few seconds, as well as wearing the same clothes you did during the blast as they would be extremely radioactive and bringing them with you would keep you exposed to the same amount of radiation as if you were staying where you are if your house survives so not knowing radiation and how deadly it is could drastically increase the death count.</p>

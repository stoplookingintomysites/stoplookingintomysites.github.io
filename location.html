	<p id="text">Where is nuclear ware most likely?:  nuclear war are most likely to occur between america the former soviot union and north korea as they are the only countries with nukes and most of the nukes will go to major cities if you are in or right beside a major cities you will most likely die from the blast and shockwave and the farther you get from the blast the less the background radiation levels will rise <br>
	Who is most at risk?:  the most vulnerable places would be the places near major cities of the countries with nukes themselves (United States, Russia, North Korea) because the ones with nukes are most likely to be attacked with nukes because you fight fire with fire however other countries can be attacked as a country being nuked will most likely send all their nukes to their enemies as a last resort to mutually assured destruction where if they die they want to do as much damage as they can to their enemies.<br>
	How can you protect yourself?:  the best thing you can do is be in a small city far from big cities in a neutral country to minimize the probability of being exposed to nukes however if are in a big city or are worried you could get a geiger counter so in the case of an emergency you could where the high levels of radiation are and when the levels are low enough that you can stay the night as governments the best thing you can do is stay out of war and make sure you have systems in place the counter missiles.</p>

	<p id="text"><span class="question">Where Is Nuclear War Most Likely?:</span>  Nuclear war is most likely to occur between America and the former Soviot Union as the two of them have a far majority of nuclear bombs and hence the power. Most of the nukes will go to major cities of America and Russia, as well as parts of countries allied with them. If you are in or beside a major citie you will most likely die from the blast and shockwave and have a lesser risk the farther you get from the blast as well as the less the background radiation levels will rise.<br>
	<span class="question">Who Is Most At Risk?:</span>  The most vulnerable places would be the places near major cities of the countries of the United States and Russia because the ones with nukes are most likely to be attacked with nukes because you fight fire with fire, however other countries can be attacked as a country being nuked will most likely send all their nukes to their enemies as a last resort to mutually assured destruction, where if they die they want to do as much damage as they can to their enemies.<br>
	<span class="question">How Can You Protect Yourself?:</span>  The best thing you can do is be in a small city far from big cities in a neutral country, to minimize the probability of being exposed to nukes, however if are in a big city or are worried you could get a geiger counter, so in the case of an emergency you could know where the high levels of radiation are, and where the levels are low enough that you can stay the night. For Governments the best thing you can do is stay out of war and make sure you have systems in place the counter missiles.</p>

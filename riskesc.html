	<p id="text"><span class="question">Why Live In A high Risk Area?:</span>  People especially with nuclear threats tend to assume rationally that it won't happen to them and hence don't want to move when there is a threat because moving is a hassle they would have to find a new job and new friends and new everything, especially since there are not many jobs far from major cities as the major cities are where comertiall is so moving seems like pain for something that probably won't happen in their lifetime and it probably won't but there is always a risk and people will take it.<br>
	<span class="question">What Kind Of Issue Are Natural Disaster?:</span>  Almost all natural disasters are caused by environmental issues as tectonic plates move which causes earthquakes or tsunamis or wind and air pressure patterns causing tornadoes or hurricanes etcâ€¦ however political and social issue as if there is political issues in the country it could get in the way of proper evacuation plans in the case of an emergency. As well as problems in the people's lives could cause them to brush off the risks of a natural disaster which could make the effects of the disaster far worse and cause many more deaths that could have been easily preventable if a proper and well researched plan was put in place.<br>
	<span class="question">How Would Rich Countries Respond Differently To A Poor Country?:</span>  A poor country would be far less likely to be nuked however almost everything in a 50-100km radius would be destroyed and almost everyone there would be killed, as there would be no detection and the only way people even know it's happening is seeing it and feeling the ground start to shake, after that the shock wave would level villages and anyone who survived would soon face radiation poisoning and 3rd degree burns. Where a rich country would still have a lot of fatalities however most people would survive the blast and shock wave if they were in a modern building far enough away from the blast that it won't be leveled however still a lot of people who will survive the blast and shockwave will die to the heat or radiation if they don't seek help or they get trapped under debris.

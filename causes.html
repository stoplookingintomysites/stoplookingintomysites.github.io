	<p id="text">What causes Nuclear war?:  causes of nuclear warfare are very political it's only caused when there is a war between 2 countries one country launches warheads the other launches warheads and then their allies start launching them until you have thousands of nukes heading to most countries in the world the ones that would be safe are the ones that are not allied stay neutral also<br>
	What scale is used to measure this disaster?:  the initial bombs are measured in kilotons or megaton or how many thousand or million tons of tnt would represent a blast of that size and radiation (the real worry) is measured in sieverts as with radiation you can't tell until you have received a near lethal dose and at that point you can't do anything<br>
	What issues could result from this disaster?:  first off politically the entire world would be a mess as a world war would be the most common case for nuclear warfare and many countries wouldn't make it more likely one or both of the main powerhouses would be gone (United States and Russia) as they sent all of their nukes to one another and possibly other helping countries as well (canada, former soviet union and china) and the economy of the world would be ruined as america imports and exports a lot of stuff that the world depends on and for it to suddenly disappear could destroy the world economy and in countries not affected like in normal crisis people would not buy as many goods as they would fear that at any moment everything could be gone so they stay inside and don't buy anything this could cause many businesses that are already in debt to collapse and could have permanent damage on the economy as a whole</p>

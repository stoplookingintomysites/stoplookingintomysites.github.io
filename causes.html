	<p id="text"><span class="question">What Causes Nuclear War?:</span>  Causes of nuclear warfare are very political it's only caused when there is a war between 2 countries one country launches warheads so the other launches warheads and then their allies start launching them until you have thousands of nukes heading to most countries in the world. The only countries that would be safe are the ones that are not allied or that stay neutral.<br>
	<span class="question">What Scale Is Used To Measure This Disaster?:</span>  The initial bombs are measured in kilotons or megatons or how many thousand or million tons of tnt would represent a blast of that size. However the main worry is radiation and is measured most commonly in sieverts, a measure of the amount of radiation energy in a kg of flesh, commonly displayed on geiger counters as nanosieverts or millisieverts per hour. Exposure to 5 sieverts means a 50% fatality rate after 30 days, however Albert Stevens survived 64 sieverts dose over 21 years and survived.<br>
	<span class="question">What Issues Could Result From This Disaster?:</span>  First off politically the entire world would be a mess as a world war would be the most common cause for nuclear warfare, as well as many countries would be gone, also the main powerhouses (United States and Russia) would almost certainly not survive, as they will send all of their nukes to one another as well as possibly other countries allied with their enemies as well (Canada, The former Soviet Union and China). This would put the global economy into ruins, as America imports and exports a lot of goods that the world depends on, for it to suddenly disappear could destroy countries that depend on them. In countries not affected, like in normal crisis people would not buy as many goods as normally wood because of fear that at any moment everything could be gone so they stay inside and don't buy anything, this could cause many businesses that are already in debt to collapse and could have permanent damage on the economy as a whole.</p>
